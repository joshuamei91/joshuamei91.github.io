## MongoDB

- Find distinct values: `db.inventory.distinct( "item.field", { queryKey: "queryValue" } )`
- Find records that are in the list: `db.collection.find( { _id : { $in : [1,2,3,4] } } )`;

- Considerations for indexing
1. Creating a large number of indexes on a database table affects data modification (e.g. Updates) operation performance. When you add or modify a row in the underlying table, the row will also be adjusted appropriately in all related table indexes. Because of that, you need to avoid creating a large number of indexes on the heavily modified tables and create the minimum possible number of indexes, with the least possible number of columns on each index.
